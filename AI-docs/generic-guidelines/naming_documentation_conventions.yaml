  naming_conventions:
    - Use kebab-case for files and directories.
    - Use snake_case for fields.
    - Use clear, descriptive text for string values.
    - Use true/false for booleans.
    - Maintain consistent item format in lists.
  documentation_conventions:
    - State everything directly; don't rely on inference.
    - Use structured data patterns instead of paragraphs.
    - Use the same patterns for similar concepts throughout.
    - Prioritize completeness over brevity.
    - Documentation should explain its own organization.
    - Include criteria for validating implementation.
