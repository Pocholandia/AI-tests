  modularity_practices:
    - Keep components/features small, focused, and self-contained.
    - Use clear naming conventions and document exports.
    - Expose only necessary APIs; encapsulate internals.
    - Write unit tests and handle errors gracefully.
    - Maintain consistency and periodically refactor.
