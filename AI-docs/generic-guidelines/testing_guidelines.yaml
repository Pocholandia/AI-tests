  testing:
    - Place tests alongside the code they test, using clear naming conventions.
    - Use unit, component, and integration tests.
    - Mock dependencies and isolate tests to avoid cross-test interference.
    - Set and enforce minimum coverage thresholds for different code areas.
    - Use realistic test data and factories/fixtures for consistency.
    - Automate tests before commits and in CI/CD pipelines.
    - Reject code that fails tests.
