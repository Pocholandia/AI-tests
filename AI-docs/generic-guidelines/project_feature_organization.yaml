  organization:
    - Organize code by domain feature.
    - Keep all code for a feature together.
    - Only import from other features via their public API.
    - Encapsulate internal logic; export only what is needed.
    - Use named exports, avoid default exports.
    - Register each feature with the meta-registry.
