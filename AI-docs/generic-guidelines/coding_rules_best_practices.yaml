  coding_rules:
    - Apply SOLID principles for maintainability and extensibility.
    - Require unit and integration tests for all functionality.
    - Separate data, business logic, and UI layers.
    - Use repository patterns for data access.
    - Extract business logic to pure functions/modules.
    - UI components focus on rendering and event routing.
    - Decompose components/modules by single responsibility.
    - Consistent state management per domain/feature.
    - Inject dependencies for testability.
    - Standardize event naming and handlers.
    - Centralize form logic and validation.
    - Implement global feedback/notification system.
    - Use adapters/wrappers for API integration.
    - Design for offline-first and synchronization.
