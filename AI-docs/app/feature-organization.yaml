  Describes the feature-based organization pattern used in the Preventa application.
main_content:
  structure:
    - Each domain feature is in its own folder under /src/features/
    - Each feature contains:
      - components/: UI components
      - models.ts: TypeScript interfaces and types
      - store.ts: Zustand store for state and business logic
      - index.ts: Public API and meta-registry registration
      - rules.ts: Business rules (optional)
  example_structure: |
    See original markdown for folder tree example.
  best_practices:
    - Keep all code for a feature together
    - Only import from other features via their index.ts (public API)
    - Encapsulate internal logic; export only what is needed
    - Use named exports, avoid default exports
    - Register each feature with the meta-registry in index.ts
