  Explains how Preventa features integrate with the Registry System for dynamic forms, selectors, and metadata.
main_content:
  entity_registration:
    - Each feature registers its entity type with the registry in its index.ts
    - Example: see original markdown for TypeScript code
  field_type_resolvers:
    - Features can provide custom field type resolvers for special fields
    - Example: see original markdown for TypeScript code
    - Register resolver with the registry factory
  best_practices:
    - Keep all registry-related code within the feature directory
    - Only expose necessary functions/types via index.ts
    - Document and test custom resolvers
