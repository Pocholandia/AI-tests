  Describes offline synchronization process, conflict resolution, and error handling for the Preventa application.
main_content:
  sync_workflow:
    - Identify pending changes in local DB (SyncStatus â‰  "synced")
    - Group by entity type
    - Upload pending changes to server
    - Download server changes since last sync
    - Detect and resolve conflicts
    - Update local DB and sync status
    - Generate sync report and update UI
  conflict_resolution:
    - Conflicts detected if both local and server versions changed, or deletion/creation conflicts
    - Strategies: local_wins, server_wins, manual
    - Manual: UI presents conflicting fields, user selects resolution
  error_handling:
    - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
    - Rollback transaction if all retries fail
    - Persist error state for later resumption
    - Sync log with timestamps and results
    - Manual sync reset for admins
