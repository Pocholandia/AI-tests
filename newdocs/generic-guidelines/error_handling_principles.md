# 1C. Error Handling Principles

- All errors must be communicated to the user in a clear and understandable way.
- Errors must be logged internally with sufficient context for debugging.
- Where possible, provide recovery options to the user and avoid data loss.
- Categorize errors by type and severity (validation, application, network/sync, etc.).
- Use a centralized notification service for user feedback (success, error, warning, info).
- Use a centralized error logging service; log errors locally if offline and send to monitoring when online.
- Use Error Boundaries (or equivalent) in the UI to catch and display unexpected errors.
- Validation errors should be shown next to the relevant fields.
- For network/offline errors, inform the user and queue actions for retry when possible.
