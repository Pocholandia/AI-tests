# 1F. UI Component and API Documentation

- All components must be documented using a standard template (description, props, usage examples).
- Separate components into page, container, and presentation layers:
  - **Page Components**: Top-level, represent a full page.
  - **Container Components**: Manage state and data flow.
  - **Presentation Components**: Render UI based on props, stateless.
- Use responsive design principles (mobile-first, breakpoints, touch targets).
- All components must be accessible and support keyboard navigation and screen readers.
