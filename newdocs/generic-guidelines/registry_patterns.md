# 3. Registry, Feature, and Metadata Patterns

### Centralized, Type-Safe, and Extensible Registries
- Use centralized registries for features, field types, and table metadata to enable dynamic discovery, extensibility, and decoupling.
- Registries should be type-safe, supporting strong typing and contract enforcement.
- Support self-registration and auto-registration of features and entities during initialization.
- Allow dynamic registration and unregistration of features, field types, and components at runtime.
- Provide APIs for registering, retrieving, listing, and unregistering items (features, field types, etc.).
- Support error handling for duplicate registration, missing features, and other registry operations.
- Enable plugin systems, feature toggles, dynamic routing, analytics, access control, progressive enhancement, feature discovery, and modular architecture through registry patterns.

### Field Registry and Field Type Resolution
- Implement a field registry for form field types, supporting dynamic detection and adaptation to different UI libraries.
- Use adapters and resolvers to decouple field rendering and validation from business logic and UI framework.
- Support branded types and type-safe field definitions.
- Provide utilities for defining fields with type safety and for dynamic field type resolution based on entity data and metadata.
- Maintain a set of pre-defined field types (e.g., text, number, checkbox, date, select, etc.) and allow easy extension.
- Ensure all fields of the same type behave and appear consistently across the application.
- Allow custom field type resolvers for advanced or domain-specific cases.

### Meta-Registry and Table Metadata
- Use a decentralized, extensible registry for table metadata, supporting per-table registration and dynamic component discovery.
- Support hook-based APIs for consuming metadata in components.
- Provide a metadata explorer UI for debugging and exploring registered tables.
- Support deep merging of metadata slices and automated testing for metadata consistency.
- Allow registration and retrieval of ad-hoc data (e.g., sync handlers, feature flags) per table.

### Feature Registry
- Register features with unique IDs, names, descriptions, icons, components, and launch functions.
- Support registering features with or without UI components.
- Provide methods to retrieve, list, and unregister features, and to check for feature existence.
- Support error handling for duplicate and missing features.
- Enable use cases such as feature toggles, plugin systems, analytics, access control, progressive enhancement, dynamic routing, feature discovery, and modular architecture.
