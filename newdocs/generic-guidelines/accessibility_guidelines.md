# 1B. Accessibility Guidelines

- Applications must conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**, **WAI-ARIA 1.1**, and **EN 301 549** standards.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible, with logical tab order and visible focus indicators.
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content (e.g., `alt` attributes for images, transcripts for audio).
- All images require alt text; form fields must have associated labels; use `aria-*` attributes appropriately.
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- Do not use color as the only means of conveying information; provide alternative indicators.
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality.
- Avoid rapid flashing or animations that could trigger seizures; honor user preferences for reduced motion.
- Provide skip links and logical heading structure for navigation.
