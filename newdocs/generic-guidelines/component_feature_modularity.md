# 4. Component and Feature Modularity

- Keep components and features small, focused, and self-contained.
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case for feature IDs).
- Document all exported functions, components, and features with clear descriptions.
- Expose only what is necessary through index files; encapsulate internal details.
- Separate concerns: keep launch logic minimal and delegate to other modules.
- Write unit tests for all components and features.
- Handle errors gracefully and document error handling strategies.
- Maintain consistency with established coding principles and patterns.
- Periodically review and refactor components and features for maintainability and performance.
